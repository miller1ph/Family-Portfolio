## Steps
1. Identify, Assess, and Evaluate Risk Profile, Investment Horizon, and overall Financial Goals / Objectives.

     - Stakeholder Risk Profile: Conservative
     - Investment Horizon: 5-6 years
     - Financial Goals: Grow the fund while ensuring:
  
             - Capital is preserved
             - Steady Income stream
             - Sufficient liquidity for emergencies for the whole duration of the Investment Horizon.
    
2. With reference to the above information and consultation with stakeholders, the following were discussed:

     - Asset Class Selection
       - Asset classes initially considered for investment include Equities, Fixed Income (Bonds), Cash and Cash Equivalents, Real Estate, Commodities, and Cryptocurrencies. However, after aligning the stakeholder's risk profile, investment horizon, and overall financial goals, it was decided to focus the investments on Cash and Cash Equivalent Instruments such as CDs, Savings Account, and Money Market Funds. The rationale for this decision are as follows (these also align with the stakeholder's financial goals/objectives):
         
                 - Cash and Cash Equivalents are the most liquid of all asset classes.
                 - These assets provide predictable and steady income streams and are not subject to market fluctuation.
                 - The current interest rates for these instruments are at MULTI-YEAR HIGHS. Current interest levels are last seen during the early 2000s.
                 - These financial assets are insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank (FDIC) / credit union (NCUA), for each account ownership category.

      - Initial Capital and Asset Allocation
       - This project commenced on May 15, 2024 with an initial capital of US$ 955,864.15. As previously discussed, capital will be invested on Cash and Cash Equivalent Instruments such as CDs, Cash, Savings Account and Money Market Funds. Initial Capital Allocation is shown below:

          As shown above, majority of the allocation were placed on CDs offered by Banks and Brokers. The rationale for the allocation are as follows:
        
           - CDs (combination of bank and brokered CDs) - 73.52%
             
             - Majority of the investments were placed on CDs to take advantage of the decade-long high interest level. There are CDs (with duration of 5 years or more) that are offering interest between 4.5% and 5%. Placing the majority of investments on such CDs would be a good idea to lock-in the high interest rate and considering the impending Federal Reserve's decision/action to cut the interest rates later this year.

         - Cash, Money Market, and Savings - 26.48%
             
             - Investments on Cash, Money Market, and Savings will be used for daily expenses, emergencies, and even buying additional CDs if attractive rates will be available in the future. These are very liquid, easy to withdraw and/or move to other investments as needed.
          

3. Risk Management

   - In order to align with the stakeholder's overall financial goals, 100% of the capital were invested in LOW-RISK investments. Furthermore, there are sufficient funds which can be easily withdrawn if needed.
   - All investments are insured by FDIC (banks) or NCUA (credit union). All allocations were computed to ensure that 100% of the funds will be covered by $250,000 per depositor per insured bank/credit union guidelines by FDIC/NCUA.
  
4. Performance Monitoring and Evaluation

   - Below is the detailed performance of each Account Type from May 15, 2024. Note that performance is measured every end of the month:

     Since the majority of my holdings are in fixed-income instruments, I will be using the ISHARES CORE US AGGREGATE BOND ETF (Ticker: AGG) as BENCHMARK for this activity. Below is the overall performance of my portfolio and its relative strength (weakness) against the benchmark:
